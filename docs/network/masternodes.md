# Masternodes

Masternodes are a core part of the Arionum network. They have been available since [Block 80,000](developers/forks?id=block-80000-renaissance).

They will be used for the assets system and other [features of the network](developers/roadmap.md).

Masternodes earn a third of each block, and require 100 thousand ARO to initialise.
